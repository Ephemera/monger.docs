## What version of Monger does this guide cover?

This guide covers Monger 1.6 (including beta releases).


## Overview

GridFS is a feature for storing large files in MongoDB. It streams files to the database in chunks so it is possible to store very large files
without having to load the entire file in RAM to store it.


## Storing files in GridFS

To store a file in MongoDB using Monger, you use a DSL from the `monger.gridfs` namespace:

``` clojure
(ns my.service
  (:use [monger.gridfs :only [store-file make-input-file filename content-type metadata]]))

;; store a file from a local FS path with the given filename, content type and metadata
(store-file (make-input-file "/path/to/a/local/file.png")
  (filename "image.png")
  (metadata {:format "png"})
  (content-type "image/png"))
```

`monger.gridfs/make-input-file` is a polymorphic function that accepts
strings, `java.io.File` and `java.io.InputStream` instances as well as
byte arrays. Strings are treated as a local file path.

When a file is stored, md5 chechsum will be calculated for its
contents automatically.


## Querying for files stored on GridFS

Files stored on GridFS are stored in two collections:

 * Chunks are stored with a reference back to the document that represents a file the chunk belongs to.
 * Files metadata (md5 chechsum, content type, filename, arbitrary user metadata) is stored as a separate document for each file.

Getting a file out of GridFS is thus a two step operation:

 * Query for a file
 * Store the file to the local filesystem (or stream it, etc). Chunks will be streamed back to the client that will store them.

It is common to query files by object id, md5 checksum or filename,
although you can query them just like you would any collection of
documents. To do so, use `monger.gridfs/find`,
`monger.gridfs/find-one`, `monger.gridfs/find-maps`,
`monger.gridfs/find-one-as-map` functions. If you need to store or
stream file, you'd need to use `monger.gridfs/find` or
`monger.gridfs/find-one` which will return back
`com.mongodb.gridfs.GridFSDBFile` instances. They can be stored to
disk to treated as input streams:

``` clojure
(ns my.service
  (:require [monger.gridfs :as gfs])
  (:use [monger.gridfs :only [store-file make-input-file filename content-type metadata]]))

(store-file (make-input-file "/path/to/a/local/file.png")
  (filename "image.png")
  (metadata {:format "png"})
  (content-type "image/png"))

;; returns a list of GridFSDBFile instances. Each of them can be stored to
;; disk using GridFSDBFile#writeTo method or converted to input stream with GridFSDBFile#getInputStream
(gfs/find {:filename "image.png"})

(-> (gfs/find-one {:filename "image.png"})
    (.writeTo "/a/new/location.png"))
```

If you just need to access file metadata, you can load it directly as Clojure maps using `monger.gridfs/find-maps` and `monger.gridfs/find-one-as-map`:

``` clojure
(ns my.service
  (:require [monger.gridfs :as gfs])
  (:use [monger.gridfs :only [store-file make-input-file filename content-type metadata]]))

(store-file (make-input-file "/path/to/a/local/file.png")
  (filename "image.png")
  (metadata {:format "png"})
  (content-type "image/png"))

;; returns a list of file metadata documents as Clojure maps
(gfs/find-maps {:filename "image.png"})

;; same as (first (gridfs/find-maps â€¦))
(gfs/find-one-as-map {:filename "image.png"})
```

If you want a list of *all* files, use `monger.gridfs/files-as-maps`
or `monger.gridfs/all-files` functions without arguments.


## Deleting Files Stored on GridFS

Deleting files on GridFS is very similar to deleting documents from a
collection. You use the `monger.gridfs/remove` function that takes a
query condition:

``` clojure
(ns my.service
  (:require [monger.gridfs :as gfs])
  (:use [monger.gridfs :only [store-file make-input-file filename content-type metadata]]))

(store-file (make-input-file "/path/to/a/local/file.png")
  (filename "image.png")
  (metadata {:format "png"})
  (content-type "image/png"))

;; deletes a file
(gfs/remove {:filename "image.png"})

;; deletes a file by md5 checksum
(gfs/remove {:md5 "1942f1e69c1d7354f93e2cf805894a9c"})
```


## Working With Multiple Databases

Monger is optimized for applications that use only one database but it
is possible to work with multiple ones. For that, use
[clojure.core/binding](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/binding)
to rebind `monger.core/*mongodb-database*`,
`monger.core/*mongodb-connection*` and `monger.core/*mongodb-gridfs*`
vars to different values or use convenience functions that do that:
`monger.core/with-connection`, `monger.core/with-db`,
`monger.core/with-gridfs`. This is a common practice for Clojure
libraries. Remember that var bindings are thread-local.



## What to read next

The documentation is organized as [a number of guides](/articles/guides.html), covering all kinds of topics.

We recommend that you read the following guides first, if possible, in this order:

 * [Using MongoDB Aggregation Framework](/articles/aggregation.html)
 * [Using MongoDB commands](/articles/commands.html)
