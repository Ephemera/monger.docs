## What version of Monger does this guide cover?

This guide covers Monger 1.6 (including beta releases).



## Inserting documents

If we don't count upserts, there are two insert functions in Monger: `monger.collection/insert` and `monger.collection/insert-batch`. Lets first take a look at the former.
It takes two arguments: collection name and document to insert:

{% gist 94a8d55fe2de8479f127 %}

`monger.collection/insert` returns write result that `monger.result/ok?` and similar functions can operate on.

`monger.collection/insert-and-return` is an alternative insertion function that returns the exact documented inserted, including the generated document id:

{% gist b0096af8387ad31fb30c %}

Document can be either a Clojure map (in the majority of cases, it is) or an instance of `com.mongodb.DBObject` (referred to later as `DBObject`).
In case your application obtains DBObjects from other libraries (for example), you can insert those:

{% gist 37931a5093b8890550f9 %}


### Document ids (ObjectId)

If you insert a document without the `:_id` key, MongoDB Java driver that Monger uses under the hood will generate one for you. It does so by mutating the document
you pass it. With Clojure's immutable data structures, that won't work the way MongoDB Java driver authors
expected.

It is highly recommended to always store documents with the `:_id` key set. If you need a generated object id. You do so by instantiating
`org.bson.types.ObjectId` without arguments:

{% gist dd4dc600f50b8c6ba093 %}

To convert a string in the object id form (for example, coming from a Web form) to an `ObjectId`, instantiate `ObjectId` with an argument:

{% gist 4ba11d5ae126c6b9e2b4 %}

Document ids in MongoDB do not have to be of the object id type, they also can be strings, integers and any value you can store that MongoDB
knows how to compare order (sort). However, using `ObjectId`s is usually a good idea.

### Generating random UUIDs

To generate a new psuedo random UUID ([type 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Variants_and_versions)), combine `java.util.UUID/randomUUID` and `clojure.core/str`:

{% gist 26c0de63fb3c2e663058 %}

or just use `monger.util/random-uuid`.


### Collection (Array) Fields

Document fields that you need to be stored as arrays are typically passed as vectors, although they can also be lists, lazy sequences or your own data types
that are list- or set-like:

{% gist 9a9779ec0c281e5b3e5f %}


### Nested Documents

Nested documents are inserted just the way one would expect: as nested Clojure maps (or DBObjects):

{% gist a99395ff5838a9ce8fb6 %}


### Serialization of Clojure data types to DBObject and DBList

Monger will construct `DBObject` instances from Clojure data types for you. The serialization process has very low overhead and supports almost all core Clojure
data types:

 * Maps
 * Lists, vectors, sets
 * Keywords (serialized as strings)
 * Symbols (serialized as strings)
 * Ratios (serialized as doubles)

Several data types are serialized transparently because they are just Java data types:

 * Strings
 * Integers, longs, doubles
 * Dates (`java.util.Date`)

In case you need to manually convert a DBObject to Clojure map or vice versa, Monger has two functions that do that,
`monger.conversion/to-db-object` and `monger.conversion/from-db-object`:

{% gist 052ed3122cf227dcab42 %}

the latter takes an optional argument that controls whether document fields are converted to Clojure keywords. When
false, field names become string keys in the result.



## Inserting batches of documents

Sometimes you need to insert a batch of documents all at once and you need it to be done efficiently. MongoDB supports batch
inserts feature. To do it with Monger, use `monger.collection/insert-batch` function:

{% gist 77f26ae67cb7bb3a9b57 %}

Please make sure to read [MongoDB documentation on error handling of batch inserts](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Inserting#Inserting-Bulkinserts)


## Checking insertion results

In real world applications, things often go wrong. Insert operations may fail for one reason or another (from duplicate `_id` key to network outages
to hardware failures to everything in between). Monger provides `monger.result` namespace with several functions that check MongoDB responses
for success:

{% gist 49731bdcf2335ac5e1a6 %}

Please note that responses will carry error/success information only with safe write concern ("safe mode") which is Monger's default. To learn more,
see [MongoDB documentation on error handling](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/getLastError+Command).


## Validating data with [Validateur, a Clojure data validation library](https://github.com/michaelklishin/validateur)

Monger does not handle data validation but it comes with a small standalone [Clojure validation library](https://github.com/michaelklishin/validateur) called Validateur.
Validateur is inspired by Ruby's ActiveModel. It has two central concepts: validators and validation sets.

Validateur is functional: validators are functions, validation sets are higher-order functions, validation results are returned as values.

With Validateur you define validation sets that compose one or more validators:

{% gist 3933002b80711cd5796b %}

Any function that returns either a pair of

{% gist e299d06d71d71b295644 %}

to indicate successful validation or

{% gist 6a802e8dec6dfd50c834 %}

to indicate validation failure and return error messages can be used as a validator. Validation sets are then passed to
`validateur.core/valid?` together with a map to validate:

{% gist 14dbb326b0419121db27 %}

`validateur.core/invalid?` is a complement to `validateur.core/valid?`.

TBD: examples with custom validators


## Setting default write concern

To set default write concern, use `monger.core/set-default-write-concern!` function:

{% gist 3b43b7f91341a393eb81 %}

For the list of available options, see [MongoDB Java driver API reference on WriteConcern](http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/WriteConcern.html).


### Monger puts safety of your data above sky-high benchmarks

By default Monger will use `WriteConcern/SAFE` as write concern. We believe that MongoDB Java driver (as well as other
official drivers) have **very unsafe defaults** when no exceptions are raised, even for network issues. This does not sound
like a good default for most applications: many applications use MongoDB because of the flexibility, not extreme write throughput
requirements. Monger's default is to be on the safe side.


## Changing write concern for individual operations

In many applications, most operations are not performance-sensitive but a few are. Some kinds of data can be lost but some is absolutely cruicial to system/company
operation. For those cases, MongoDB and Monger allow developers to trade
some write throughput for safety (or vice versa) by specifying a different write concern value for individual operations:

{% gist 78b183038e93113d0b3d %}

When doing so, please keep MongoDB's differences in [error handling](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/getLastError+Command) in mind.


## Working with multiple databases

Monger is optimized for applications that use only one database but it is possible to work with multiple ones. For that, use [clojure.core/binding](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/binding) to rebind
`monger.core/*mongodb-database*`, `monger.core/*mongodb-connection*` and `monger.core/*mongodb-gridfs*` vars to different values or use convenience functions
that do that: `monger.core/with-connection`, `monger.core/with-db`, `monger.core/with-gridfs`. This is a common practice for Clojure libraries. Remember that
var bindings are thread-local.

 * [Updating documents](/articles/updating.html)
 * [Deleting documents](/articles/deleting.html)
 * [Indexing and other collection operations](/articles/collections.html)

 * [Map/Reduce](/articles/mapreduce.html)
 * [GridFS support](/articles/gridfs.html)
