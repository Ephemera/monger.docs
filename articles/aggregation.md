## What version of Monger does this guide cover?

This guide covers Monger 1.6 (including beta releases).


## What version of MongoDB does this guide cover?

This guide covers a feature that is going to be introduced with the release of MongoDB 2.2. Support for it was developed using
2.1.x releases (developer previews).


## Overview

MongoDB 2.2 also supports a more focused, less generic and easier to use data processing feature called the [Aggregation Framework](/articles/aggregation.html) which
makes raw map/reduce a relatively low-level facility.


## Performing MongoDB aggregation queries with Clojure

Conceptually, documents from a collection pass through an aggregation pipeline, which transforms these objects they pass through. For those familiar with UNIX-like shells
(e.g. bash,) the concept is analogous to the pipe (i.e. `|`) used to string text filters together.

In a shell environment the pipe redirects a stream of characters from the output of one process to the input of the next. The MongoDB aggregation pipeline streams MongoDB
documents from one pipeline operator to the next to process the documents.

All pipeline operators process a stream of documents and the pipeline behaves as if the operation scans a collection and passes all matching documents into the “top” of
the pipeline. Each operator in the pipleine transforms each document as it passes through the pipeline.

`monger.collection/aggregate` is the function used to perform aggregation queries with Monger. It takes a collection name and a list of aggregation
*pipeline stages* or *pipeline operators*, such as `$project` or `$multiplyBy`.

Pipeline operators are specified as documents (Clojure maps) and contain `$operators` similar to those used by perform queries and updates. They can be specified
as strings, e.g. "$project", or using predefined operators from the `monger.operators` namespace, e.g. `$project`:

``` clojure
(ns monger.docs.examples
  (:require [monger.collection :as mc])
  (:use monger.operators))

;; performs an aggregation query.
;;
;; The following data set
;;
;; [{ :state "CA" :quantity 1 :price 199.00 }
;;  { :state "NY" :quantity 2 :price 199.00 }
;;  { :state "NY" :quantity 1 :price 299.00 }
;;  { :state "IL" :quantity 2 :price 11.50  }
;;  { :state "CA" :quantity 2 :price 2.95   }
;;  { :state "IL" :quantity 3 :price 5.50   }]
;;
;; will be reduced to
;;
;; [{:_id "NY" :subtotal 398.0}
;;  {:_id "NY" :subtotal 299.0}
;;  {:_id "IL" :subtotal 23.0}
;;  {:_id "CA" :subtotal 5.9}
;;  {:_id "IL" :subtotal 16.5}
;;  {:_id "CA" :subtotal 199.0}]
;;

(mc/aggregate "docs" [{$project {:subtotal {$multiply ["$quantity", "$price"]}
                                                       :_id     "$state"}}])

;; alternative version, does not use predefined monger.operators/$project and monger.operators/$multiply operators
(mc/aggregate "docs" [{"$project" {:subtotal {"$multiply" ["$quantity", "$price"]}
                                                          :_id     "$state"}}])
```

Unlike Map/Reduce operators, aggregation queries are always returned "inline" (as a value by `monger.collection/aggregate`).


## What to read next

For an in-depth overview of the MongoDB 2.2 Aggregation Framework,
please refer to this [MongoDB Aggregation Framework
guide](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/aggregation/). There
is also a [pipeline operator
reference](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/aggregation/).

The documentation is organized as [a number of
guides](/articles/guides.html), covering all kinds of topics.

We recommend that you read the following guides first, if possible, in this order:

 * [Using MongoDB commands](/articles/commands.html)
